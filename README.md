# Vanity Transaction Hash for Contract Deployment

An Ethereum vanity transaction hash generator designed to brute-force transaction hashes for contract deployments on any EVM-compatible blockchain, leveraging the deterministic nature of the EVM.

## Overview

This tool functions by incrementally adjusting the transaction's gas price by 1 wei per attempt, parallelised across multiple threads with a 0.1 gwei offset per threadâ€”providing each worker thread with a total search space of 100,000,000 transaction hashes. Once a matching transaction hash is found, the user is prompted to confirm and broadcast the transaction.

>**Example transaction:**

>**Note:** The example provided above also includes a vanity contract address and a vanity EOA, which are not in the scope of this project. I used [1inch's updated (and secure) fork of profanity2](https://github.com/1inch/profanity2) to get the contract address and I created a different rust script to generate the EOA vanity address. However, in general, vanity EOAs are less secure than random addresses, so I wouldn't recommend using them.

This tool doesn't really have any real-world application beyond "looking cool" onchain, but it was a fun hobby project to work on.

## Features

- Generate vanity transaction hashes for contract deployments
- Parallel processing for faster hash generation
- Compatible with any EVM that uses EIP-1559 for transaction fees
- Gas price monitoring utility based on most recent block (gas_checker.rs)

## Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo installed
- Your EVM contract bytecode
- EVM RPC endpoint
- Private key for transaction signing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vanity-tx-hash.git
   cd vanity-tx-hash
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   RPC=your_rpc_endpoint_url
   CHAIN_ID=your_chain_id
   HASH_PREFIX=desired_transaction_hash_prefix
   CALLDATA=your_contract_bytecode
   GAS_LIMIT=set_your_max_spend
   ```

## Configuration

**Note:** Starting gas price for base and priority fee are set in `main.rs` (line 44 + 45), and each thread is offset by 0.1 gwei (see `THREAD_OFFSET_SPACING` line 21). These values worked well for me during testing on Base Sepolia - adjust as needed for the target EVM.

## Usage

### Gas Price Checker

Check current network gas prices and adjust main.rs if needed:
```bash
cargo run --bin gas_checker
```

### Vanity Contract Deployment

Run the main program to deploy your contract with a custom transaction hash prefix:
```bash
cargo run
```

Once a match is found you'll see the transaction hash, contract address and estimated gas cost in your console and need to confirm for the transaction to be broadcast.
